<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know that company called Facebook? Yeah, the one that has <strong>1.6 billion</strong> people hooked on their website. Take all of the happy birthday posts, embarrassing pictures of you as a little kid, that one family relative that likes <em>every</em> single one of your statuses, and you have a whole lot of data to analyze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In terms of analyzing the images, Facebook has undoubtedly made great progress with deep CNNs. A little over a week ago, the team at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) published a <a href="https://research.facebook.com/blog/learning-to-segment/">blog post</a> detailing the computer vision techniques that are behind some of their object segmentation algorithms. In this post, we&rsquo;ll go into summarizing and explaining the 3 papers that the blog referenced.</p>

<p>The main pipeline that FAIR utilizes goes as follows. Images are fed into a DeepMask segmentation framework. The segments are refined through a SharpMask model and classified with MultiPathNet. Let&rsquo;s look at how each of these components operates separately.</p>

<p>Facebook kinda has this CNN stuff down. <i class="em em-sunglasses"></i></p>

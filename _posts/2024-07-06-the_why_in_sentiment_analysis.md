Sentiment analysis is a fantastic tool for summarising millions of precious words in customer feedback to understand the overall levels of satisfaction/disatisfaction. But wouldn't it be great to know more detail as to WHY? By leveraging the NLTK library and Naive Bayes algorithm, we isolate key words that give us a clue into WHY customers are satisfied or deeply disatisfied with a particular product. The idea is that these words will provide us actionable insights to augment what is working to optimise profit or address the most pressing sources of frustration to prevent churn.

I will walk us through the whole process from data loading, data cleansing, tokenizing to ultimately drawing up the final visualisations and insights for a hypthetical context so that you can apply these techniques in your own data.

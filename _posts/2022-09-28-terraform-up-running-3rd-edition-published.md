Today, I'm excited to announce that the [3rd edition of Terraform: Up &
Running](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/) is now published! It includes over 100 pages of new content, including 
two totally new chapters, one on managing secrets with Terraform and one on working with multiple providers, plus major 
changes to all the existing chapters, updating the book from Terraform 0.12 all the way to Terraform 1.2.

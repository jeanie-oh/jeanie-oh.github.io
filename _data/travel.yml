    "All happy cloud deployments are alike; each unhappy cloud deployment is unhappy in its own way." — Leo Tolstoy,
    Site Reliability Engineer<br><br>
    At Gruntwork, I've had the chance to see the cloud adoption journeys of hundreds of companies, from tiny startups to
    Fortune 50 giants. I've seen those journeys go well. I've seen those journeys go poorly. In this talk, I discuss a
    few of the ways cloud adoption can go horribly wrong (massive cost overruns, endless death marches, security disasters),
    and more importantly, how you can get it right. To help you get it right, we looked at the cloud journeys that were
    successful and extracted from them the patterns they had in common. We distilled all this experience down into
    something called the Gruntwork Production Framework, which defines five concrete steps you can follow to adopt the
    cloud at your own company—and hopefully, to end up with your very own happy cloud deployment.

    I did a podcast interview with Software Engineering Radio on Infrastructure as Code best practices. The discussion
    covers similarities and differences between conventional software engineering and code-driven infrastructure;
    factoring code into modules; layering; terraform code organization for micro-services; releases and tagging; code
    reviews; unit testing infrastructure; deployment of infrastructure; ownership and code structure models; and open
    source and re-usable libraries.

    This talk from QCon SF is a step-by-step, live-coding class on how to write automated tests for infrastructure
    code, including the code you write for use with tools such as Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and Packer. Topics
    covered include unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, test parallelism, retries, error handling, static
    analysis, and more.

    My talk from QCon London where I shared key lessons from the "Infrastructure Cookbook" we developed at Gruntwork
    while creating and maintaining a library of over 300,000 lines of infrastructure code used in production by
    hundreds of companies. Topics include how to design infrastructure APIs, automated tests for infrastructure code,
    patterns for reuse and composition, refactoring, namespacing, and more.

    This talk from HashiConf 2018 is a concise masterclass on how to write infrastructure code. I share key lessons
    from the "Infrastructure Cookbook" we developed at Gruntwork while creating and maintaining a library of over
    300,000 lines of infrastructure code that's used in production by hundreds of companies. Come and hear our war
    stories, laugh about all the mistakes we’ve made along the way, and learn what Terraform, Packer, Docker, and Go
    look like in the wild.

    This is my talk from HashiConf 2017 where I introduce the work we've been doing at Gruntwork with Terraform Modules.
    I explain how modules work, how to design modules so they are highly configurable and reusable, and how to write
    automated tests for your Terraform code. Most importanly, I show you how you can use modules to build your entire
    tech stack on top of proven, battle-tested infrastructure code—in minutes.

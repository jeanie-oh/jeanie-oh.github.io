    Just a chic that LOVES data! <br></h2>
    Thanks for visiting this site! I love working with data. There is so much data available today but I noticed its often not delivered to me 
    in a way I can interact with and get more detailed information. This blog is my hypothesis that I'm not the only one. I aspire to post blogs 
    that presents data in a way that is more engaging, informative and fun.

    <p>
      Thanks for visiting this site. I'm just a data chic that loves working with data. Despite the age of massive proliferation in data, AI and other technologies, I found it hard to find data delivered to me in a way I can interact with it and get more detailed information. This site is my hypothesis that I'm not the only one and wanted to post blogs that service data in a way people can interact with, be informed and entertained.
